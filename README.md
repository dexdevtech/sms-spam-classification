# TEXT MESSAGE SPAM DETECTION MACHINE LEARNING PROJECT
This project is a retrospective on our machine learning capstone projects during the first semester of our senior year in college. Back in early 2023, spam messaging was rampant in the Philippines. It was a significant social issue that the country was grappling with, to the extent that an act needed to be passed to address this problemâ€”the Sim Registration Act. During the peak of malicious spamming in the Philippines, our group decided to create a machine learning model for classifying text messages as spam or not. This GitHub project serves as a reflection on that undertaking, along with the decisions and changes I would have considered if I could go back in time, including project organization and clean code practices.

### Project Description:
This project focuses on finding the optimal model for text message spam classification through a detailed process:


0.  **The Dataset**: The dataset used in this project is a culmination of 3 different datasets. This is done to introduce data diversity and overcome high imbalance.

1. **Dataset Partitions**: Three different training datasets are created. They are divided into these ham to spam partitions: 70-30, 60-40, and 50-50. These datasets are used for training and testing machine learning models, independent of each other.

2. **Model Selection in Each Partition**: Out of 11 different classification algorithms, the best model was identified by training all the models using default parameters and cross validating the results, (hold out validation was done but not considered in selecting best model because of bias).

3. **Model Optimization**: All the best models from each partition were further optimized to enhance their performance.

4. **Model Comparison**: After optimization, I compared the performance of these models to select the best-performing one among them.
